        <h2>Golden Age</h2>
        <br>
        <p><span style="text-indent: 20px;">T</span>The term Golden Age comes from Greek
             mythology, particularly the Works and Days of Hesiod, and is part of the description
             of temporal decline of the state of peoples through five Ages, Gold being the first
             and the one during which the Golden Race of humanity lived <span style="font-weight: bold;color:rgb(245,101,6);">After the end of the first
             </span> age was the Silver.
                <br>
                
                By extension, "Golden Age" denotes a period of primordial peace, harmony, stability,
             and prosperity. During this age, peace and harmony prevailed in that people did not have
            to work to feed themselves for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very
             old age with a youthful appearance, eventually dying peacefully, with spirits living on as "guardians".</p>

                "Time is money" is an aphorism that is claimed to have originated[1] in "Advice to a 
                Young Tradesman", an essay by Benjamin Franklin that appeared in George Fisher’s
                 1748 book, The American Instructor: or Young Man’s Best Companion, 
                 in which Franklin wrote, "Remember that time is money.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Remember that time is money. He that can earn ten shillings a day by his labour, 
                 and goes abroad, or sits idle one half of that day, though he spends but sixpence
                  during his diversion or idleness, it ought not to be reckoned the only expence.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  However, the phrase was already in print in 1719 in the Whig newspaper The 
                  Free-Thinker: "In vain did his Wife inculcate to him, That Time is Money
                  The saying is
                  intended to convey the monetary cost of laziness, by pointing out that when one is
                  paid for the amount of time one spends working, minimizing non-working time also minimizes
                  the amount of money that is lost to other pursuits.
